## VR Lab: Lab 1

For Lab one I used the clamps and snapzones provided by the VRTK toolkit as my interactables.  I only used half the clamps.  The ones near the good car with the blue car battery.  The blue car battery attaches the clamps to the snapzones.  There are instructions as to where each clamp goes.  They don't have to be placed in any particular order but the position is important so that the snapzone can locate and find it.  As long as the red clamp is snapped on the left side of the blue car battery and as long as the black clamp is snapped on the right it should trigger the interaction from their interacting.  I attempted to use fade to black.  But the fade happens to quickly, you don't really notice it.  The clamps and the cars go together with the theme as they are objects/assets included with the toolkit.
