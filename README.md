As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.

## VR Lab: Lab 1

For Lab one I used the clamps and snapzones provided by the VRTK toolkit as my interactables.  I only used half the clamps.  The ones near the good car with the blue car battery.  The blue car battery attaches the clamps to the snapzones.  There are instructions as to where each clamp goes.  They don't have to be placed in any particular order but the position is important so that the snapzone can locate and find it.  As long as the red clamp is snapped on the left side of the blue car battery and as long as the black clamp is snapped on the right it should trigger the interaction from their interacting.  I attempted to use fade to black.  But the fade happens to quickly, you don't really notice it.  The clamps and the cars go together with the theme as they are objects/assets included with the toolkit.

## AR Lab: Lab 2

For Lab two I continued from where we left off in class.  I got the ground plane working in class.  I even got the mid air stage working briefly.  I downloaded a low poly model of a car that is meant to appear when the user clicks on the plane.  Which is the same plane used in class.  I believe that the Vuforia engine is already working with ARkit and ARCore.  The low poly model should appear on the plan and should track and follow the planes movements.  I learned from the assigned reading and from class that AR is more  widely adopted than VR because of its ease of accessibility compared to VR.  We all need cell phones and thats the most common device used for AR.  I learned from the reading that AR has been around for many years but in a different form.  Sports has been utilizing AR before AR was even a thing.  And AR is applied in the medical field as well to help students perform research and learn more about medical related subjects.
